This project implements a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud by analyzing transaction patterns and identifying anomalies. Using a Random Forest Classifier, this model is trained to distinguish between legitimate and potentially fraudulent transactions based on various transaction attributes. The dataset has been preprocessed to handle imbalanced classes and improve the model's accuracy.

Throughout this project, resources and concepts were referenced from GeeksforGeeks, which provided foundational knowledge on implementing and optimizing machine learning algorithms. This repository includes the complete code, data preprocessing steps, model evaluation metrics, and visualizations to illustrate the modelâ€™s performance.
